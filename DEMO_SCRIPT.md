- Demonstrate citation clicking
- Show search result filtering

**What to say:**
> "The search is powered by vector similarity and AI. I can ask natural language questions and get intelligent answers with citations. The system uses hybrid search combining keyword and semantic matching. Citations are clickable and show the source memories."

**Key points to highlight:**
- Natural language search queries
- AI-generated answers with citations
- Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- Clickable citations
- Real-time search results

---

### **BLOCKCHAIN VERIFICATION & HYPERINDEX (3:30 - 4:00) - 30 seconds**
**What to show:**
- Show transaction hashes on memories
- Navigate to HyperIndex page
- Display blockchain data (block numbers, gas used)
- Show transaction status indicators
- Demonstrate blockchain verification

**What to say:**
> "Every memory is verified on the blockchain. Here you can see transaction hashes, block numbers, and gas usage. The HyperIndex provides detailed blockchain analytics. This creates an immutable proof of when and what you captured, making your memories verifiable and tamper-proof."

**Key points to highlight:**
- Transaction hashes and blockchain data
- HyperIndex analytics dashboard
- Gas usage and block information
- Immutable verification
- Real-time transaction status
