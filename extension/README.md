# RecallOS Browser Extension

A browser extension that automatically captures and processes your web browsing activity to create a searchable, verifiable memory network powered by AI and blockchain technology.

## Features

- **Automatic Content Capture**: Monitors web pages and extracts meaningful content

- **Memory Mesh**: Creates connections between related content and ideas
- **Blockchain Verification**: Stores content hashes on Sepolia testnet for permanent verification
- **AI Integration**: Works with ChatGPT and other AI tools for context-aware responses
- **Privacy-First**: Never captures private or local content

## Quick Start

2. **Extract**: Unzip the downloaded file to a folder on your computer
3. **Install**: Load the extension in Chrome/Edge developer mode
4. **Connect**: Link your wallet to start using RecallOS

ðŸ“– **For detailed installation instructions, see [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md)**

### Usage

1. **Browse Normally**: Just use the web as you normally do
2. **Automatic Capture**: RecallOS quietly captures and processes content in the background
3. **Search Memories**: Use the extension popup to search your captured memories
4. **AI Integration**: Chat with AI tools that now have access to your memory network
